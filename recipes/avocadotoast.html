<h3>A spicy delicious easy to make avocado toast</h3>

<p>We’re going back to basics this summer, so let’s talk about avocado toast! Creamy avocado spread onto well-toasted bread is one of my favorite quick meals. Actually, it’s one of my favorite meals in general. It’s so delicious, I’d call it one of life’s simplest pleasures.</p>
<p>If you are a stranger to avocado toast, you’ve been missing out and we must remedy this situation immediately.

    If you’re well-familiar with the joy of avocado toast, I hope you find some helpful tips and some fun new ways to change up your toast. Onward!</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
<li>1 slice of bread</li>
<li>1 ripe avocado</li>
<li>Pinch of salt</li>
<li>1/4 tps of paprika</li>
<li>1/2 tsp of chili flakes</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Toast your slice of bread until golden and firm.</li>
    <li>Remove the pit from your avocado. Use a big spoon to scoop out the flesh. Put it in a bowl and mash it up with a fork until it’s as smooth as you like it. Mix in a pinch of salt (about ⅛ teaspoon) and add more to taste, if desired.</li>
    <li>Spread avocado on top of your toast. Enjoy as-is or top with any extras offered in this post (I highly recommend a light sprinkle of flaky sea salt, if you have it).</li>


</ol>

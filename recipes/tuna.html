<h3>Simple & Fresh Tuna Tataki</h3>
<p>Tuna tataki is a simple Japanese dish that combines delicate, gently-seared tuna with a citrus-soy sauce given a gentle ginger kick. It's easy to make and makes a great appetizer or component to a light bento box-style meal.</p>
<p>The name tuna tataki can actually refer to two different Japanese dishes. One is what I have made here, quick-seared tuna cut in slices and served with a citrus-soy sauce. The other is more like a Japanese-flavored tartare, where the tuna is diced small and mixed with typically ginger and other flavors.</p>

<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
  <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li> 
  <li>1 tbsp orange juice</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp lemon juice</li> 
  <li>1/2 tsp mirin</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp freshly grated ginger</li>
  <li>1/2 lb yellow fin tuna</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In a small bowl, mix together the orange juice, lemon juice, soy sauce, mirin and ginger. Set aside.</li>
    <li>If your piece of tuna is wider, cut it into two similar-sized pieces, ideally both square/rectangular ended and even width.</li>
<li>Warm the oil in a skillet big enough for the piece of tuna over a medium-high heat until it starts to smoke slightly.</li>
<li>Add the tuna to the pan and cook for no more than around 30-45 seconds each side to sear it. Remove from the pan and set aside a couple minutes.</li>
<li> Using a very sharp knife, cut the tuna thinly across the grain. Arrange the slices on a larger platter or two plates to serve. Drizzle over the sauce and decorate the plate, if you like eg with slices of lemon, green onions.</li>
</ol>
